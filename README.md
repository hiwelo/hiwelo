# Hej folks! I am Damien üëã ü¶ù 

I am a **Queer UX Engineer**, using [they/them pronouns](https://pronoun.is/them). I design design systems, and try to make Web accessibility more accessible, and the Web a more inclusive place.

With [my studio](https://raccoon.studio), I am helping compagnies to **build their design systems** and to **more accessible products**.

At the moment, I'm working on bringing [The 3rd Place](https://3rd.place) to life: an cross-platform media about urban planning and mobility.

Recently, I created and led the design systems at [Castor](https://castoredc.com). The goal was to help design and engineering teams to be closer, and build more efficiently new features. This project was done with a specific focus on semantics, usability, and progressive enhancement in mind.

I also help people to bring accessibility in their work and projects, and to develop design systems through **workshops** and **courses**. 
I also often [talk about Web accessibility, readability and building accessible design systems](https://noti.st/hiwelo) in conferences worldwide.
