# Hi folks! ðŸ‘‹

I am Damien, a **Queer UX Engineer**, designing design systems, trying to make Web accessibility accessible, and the Web a more inclusive place.

With [my studio](https://raccoon.studio), I am **designer and developer** helping compagnies to **develop their design systems** and to **make their products more accessible**.

Currently, I lead the design system project at [Castor](https://castoredc.com) to help them building more efficiently new views and features with semantics, usability, and progressive enhancement in mind.

I also help people to bring accessibility in their work and projects and to develop design systems through workshops and courses. 
I also often talk about Web accessibility, readability and building accessible design systems in conferences worldwide.

If you are a podcast listener, I am also about to start a new project called [Tokens](https://podcast.tokens.systems) to discuss design systems projects and the daily life of their teams.
