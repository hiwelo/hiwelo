# Hej folks! I am Damien üëã ü¶ù 

I am a **Queer UX Engineer**, using [they/them pronouns](https://pronoun.is/them). I design design systems, and try to make Web accessibility more accessible, and the Web a more inclusive place.

With [my studio](https://raccoon.studio), I am helping compagnies to **build their design systems** and to **build more accessible products**.

Currently, I lead the design system project at [Castor](https://castoredc.com). Together, we're trying to help their frontend teams to build more efficiently new views and features with semantics, usability, and progressive enhancement in mind.

I also help people to bring accessibility in their work and projects and to develop design systems through **workshops** and **courses**. 
I also often [talk about Web accessibility, readability and building accessible design systems](https://speaking.raccoon.studio) in conferences worldwide.

If you are a podcast listener, I am also about to start a new project called [Tokens](https://podcast.tokens.systems) to discuss design systems projects and the daily life of their teams.
